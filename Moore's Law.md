### **Definition of Moore's Law**

Moore's Law is an observation made by Gordon Moore in 1965. 
It states that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles approximately every two years, 
leading to exponential growth in computing power and a decrease in the cost per transistor. 
This trend was made possible by continuous improvements in semiconductor manufacturing and 
miniaturization of transistor sizes.

### **Why Moore's Law Has Stopped Being True**

In recent years, Moore's Law has slowed and is no longer strictly accurate. 
This is due to several **physical limitations** and **economic challenges** in the semiconductor industry:

---

### **1. Physical Limitations**

#### **a. Transistor Size Approaching Atomic Scale**
- Transistor sizes are now at or below 3 nanometers, where they approach the size of individual atoms. Further shrinking is challenging because:
    - Quantum effects, like tunneling, cause electrons to "leak" across barriers, making transistors unreliable.
    - The precision required to manufacture at this scale pushes the limits of lithography techniques.

#### **b. Heat and Power Dissipation**
- Smaller transistors allow for higher density, but higher densities generate more heat. Cooling systems cannot dissipate the heat effectively at these scales, leading to thermal limits on performance.
- As power consumption scales with transistor density, chips become inefficient beyond certain thresholds.

#### **c. Threshold Voltage and Noise Margins**
- Reducing transistor size requires lowering the operating voltage. However, voltages cannot drop below a certain threshold without causing unreliable switching and reduced noise margins.

### **2. Economic and Manufacturing Challenges**

#### **a. Increasing Manufacturing Costs**
- The cost of developing and producing advanced semiconductor processes (e.g., 3nm or 2nm nodes) has skyrocketed.
- Only a few companies (e.g., TSMC, Intel, Samsung) can afford to invest in the required equipment and technology, and this restricts widespread adoption.

#### **b. Diminishing Returns**
- The performance improvements from increasing transistor density are no longer as dramatic. Power efficiency and speed improvements have plateaued, making further scaling less cost-effective.

### **3. Alternatives to Mooreâ€™s Law**

As scaling transistors further becomes impractical, the industry is exploring alternatives:
- **3D stacking (chiplets):** Building vertically layered chips to increase performance without shrinking individual transistors.
- **Heterogeneous computing:** Combining specialized processors (e.g., GPUs, TPUs, FPGAs) with general-purpose CPUs to improve efficiency.
- **Quantum computing:** Leveraging quantum mechanics for entirely new paradigms of computation.

In summary, Moore's Law has reached its limits due to physical constraints, such as quantum effects and heat dissipation, as well as economic factors like high manufacturing costs and diminishing returns.
While transistor scaling may no longer follow Moore's trajectory, innovation continues in other areas of computing.
